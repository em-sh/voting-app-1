# Voting App – CI/CD with AKS, GitHub, ArgoCD

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete CI/CD setup using **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**, **GitHub**, **Azure Pipelines**, and **ArgoCD**.

### Application Architecture

* 🟣 **Python Front-end Web App**: Allows users to vote between two options.
* 🔴 **Redis**: Collects new votes in real-time.
* 🟣 **.NET Worker Service**: Consumes votes from Redis and stores them.
* 🟣 **PostgreSQL Database**: Persists data, backed by a Docker volume.
* 🟣 **Node.js Results Web App**: Displays real-time voting results.

## ⚙️ CI Setup (Continuous Integration)

* ✅ Code hosted on **GitHub** (source of truth for both app code and Kubernetes manifests).
* ✅ **Azure Pipelines** integrated with GitHub.
* ✅ **CI Pipeline Workflow**:

  * Build multi-service Docker images.
  * Push images to **Azure Container Registry (ACR)**.
  * Run `updateK8sManifests.sh` to update image tags in Kubernetes YAML files.
  * Push updated manifests back to GitHub.

## 🚀 CD Setup (Continuous Deployment)

* ✅ **AKS Cluster** created on Azure with **VMSS Node Pools** for scalability and high availability.
* ✅ **ArgoCD** watches the GitHub repository for changes.
* ✅ On changes (new image tag commit), ArgoCD automatically updates the deployment in AKS without manual intervention.
* ✅ **Fully Automated CI/CD Pipeline** from code push to deployment.
